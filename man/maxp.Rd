\arguments{
\item{w}{An instance of Weight class}

\item{data}{A 2d numeric list of selected variable}

\item{bound_vals}{A 1-d vector of selected bounding variable}

\item{min_bound}{A minimum value that the sum value of bounding variable int each cluster should be greater than}

\item{local_search}{The name of the heurist algorithm to find a optimal solution. Default to "greedy". Options are "greedy", "tabu" and "sa" (simulated annealing)}

\item{distance_method}{(optional) The distance method used to compute the distance betwen observation i and j. Defaults to "euclidean". Options are "euclidean" and "manhattan"}

\item{random_seed}{(optional) The seed for random number generator. Defaults to 123456789.}

\item{initial}{(optional): The number of iterations of greedy algorithm. Defaults to 99.}

\item{tabu_length}{(optional): The length of a tabu search heuristic of tabu algorithm. Defaults to 95.}

\item{cool_rate}{(optional): The cooling rate of a simulated annealing algorithm. Defaults to 0.85}

\item{init_seeds}{(optional): The initial clusters that the local search starts with, e.g. one can assign the LISA cluster as the init_seeds for max-p method. Default is empty. means the local search starts with a random process to "grow" clusters}

\description{
The max-p-region problem is a special case of constrained clustering where a finite number of geographical areas, n, are aggregated into the maximum number of regions, p, such that each region satisfies the following const raints: 1. The areas within a region must be geographically connected.
